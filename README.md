# Exploratory Data Analysis on Kelley Blue Book Used Car Listings

In this project, over 17000 used car listings were scraped from Kelley Blue Book's website.  
The data was cleaned and some initial EDA was done.

To see some predictive modelling in action see my blog post on [Support Vector Machines](https://tai-pach.github.io/r/Support-Vector-Machines/) to see how we can predict car body type from other car features.
